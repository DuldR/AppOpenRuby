Methods in Ruby will automatically return the evaluation of their last executed expression. You will still need to use the explicit return keyword to do an early return.

# Less preferred
def get_avg(num_1, num_2)
    return (num_1 + num_2) / 2
end

# Preferred by a Rubyist
def get_avg(num_1, num_2)
    (num_1 + num_2) / 2
end

Default Arugments

As you are writing methods there are times where you may want to make an argument optional. In this scenario, we can assign a default value in the parameter list:

# Let's make num an optional parameter.
# By default, num will have the value of 1
def repeat(message, num=1)
    message * num
end

p repeat("hi") # => "hi"
p repeat("hi", 3) # => "hihihi"

The repeat method above has an optional num argument. If we call repeat without explicitly passing in a value for num, num will be implicitly passed in with the value 1. This is useful for implementing methods with a default behavior.

We are free to use any default value for an optional argument, so the possibilities are endless. A fairly common design pattern is to set an arg to nil by default and have logic based on that scenario:

def greet(person_1, person_2=nil)
    if person_2.nil?
        p "Hey " + person_1
    else
        p "Hey " + person_1 + " and " + person_2 
    end
end

greet("Chao") # => "Hey Chao"
greet("Chao", "Arittro") # => "Hey Chao and Arittro"

To avoid confusion, it's best practice to have optional parameters listed after the required ones. If we stick to this convention, we can always expect arguments to be taken in the same order we pass them in. So avoid writing code like this:

def greet(person_1="default", person_2)
    p person_1 + " and " + person_2
end

greet("Chao") # => "default and Chao"

The method above is not intuitive because although "Chao" is first argument passed in, person_2 will be assigned "Chao". Avoid this by only assigning default values at the end of the parameter list.
Option Hashes

If you have a method that accepts a hash as an argument, you can omit the braces when passing in the hash:

def method(hash)
    p hash  # {"location"=>"SF", "color"=>"red", "size"=>100}
end

method({"location"=>"SF", "color"=>"red", "size"=>100})

# this also works:
method("location"=>"SF", "color"=>"red", "size"=>100)

This can really clean things up when you have other arguments before the hash:

def modify_string(str, options)
    str.upcase! if options["upper"]
    p str * options["repeats"]
end

# less readable
modify_string("bye", {"upper"=>true, "repeats"=>3}) # => "BYEBYEBYE"

# more readable
modify_string("bye", "upper"=>true, "repeats"=>3)   # => "BYEBYEBYE"

Combining this with the default arguments we covered in the previous section can make our code even more flexible:

def modify_string(str, options={"upper"=>false, "repeats"=>1})
    str.upcase! if options["upper"]
    p str * options["repeats"]
end

modify_string("bye")   # => "bye"
modify_string("bye", "upper"=>true, "repeats"=>3)   # => "BYEBYEBYE"

Splat Operator

There are few different ways to use the splat (*) operator in Ruby. Let's explore each of them so we can add them to our programming tool belt.
Using splat to accept additional arguments

Ruby methods are pretty strict in that we must pass in the exact number of arguments that a method expects. If we pass in too many, we will receive an error:

def method(arg_1, arg_2)
    p arg_1
    p arg_2
end

method("a", "b", "c", "d", "e") # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 5, expected 2)

Building upon the code above, if we want our method to have the ability to accept at least two arguments with potentially more, we can add a splat parameter. The additional arguments will be gathered into an array for us to use as we see fit:

def method(arg_1, arg_2, *other_args)
    p arg_1         # "a"
    p arg_2         # "b"
    p other_args    # ["c", "d", "e"]
end

method("a", "b", "c", "d", "e") 

If we pass in exactly two arguments, then other_args will be an empty array:

def method(arg_1, arg_2, *other_args)
    p arg_1         # "a"
    p arg_2         # "b"
    p other_args    # []
end

method("a", "b") 

Notice that in any scenario, the arguments are passed in positionally. This means that in the example above, arg_1 is assigned "a", arg_2 is assigned "b", and there is no additional data being passed, so other_args is empty.

As a best practice, we should use splat at the end of the parameter list to avoid confusion. So avoid writing code like this:

# Avoid doing this, it's confusing:
def method(*other_args, required_arg)
    p other_args    # ["a", "b"]
    p required_arg  # "c"
end

method("a", "b", "c")

Using splat to decompose an array

We can also use splat to decompose or unpack elements of an array. Let's say we had an array containing some elements, but we wanted each individual element to become an argument:

def greet(first_name, last_name)
    p "Hey " + first_name + ", your last name is " + last_name
end

names = ["grace", "hopper"]
greet(names)    # ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 1, expected 2)

The code above does not work because we are passing in the full array as the first_name, making last_name a missing argument. Thankfully we can use a splat to unpack this array:

def greet(first_name, last_name)
    p "Hey " + first_name + ", your last name is " + last_name
end

names = ["Grace", "Hopper"]
greet(*names)    # => "Hey Grace, your last name is Hopper"

When using splat to unpack an array, you can imagine that the * will remove the brackets ([]) that enclose the array. This leaves us with a simple comma separated list, perfect for passing in arguments. If you imagine * as removing the brackets around an array, we can figure out some other creative ways to use this tool:

arr_1 = ["a", "b"]
arr_2 = ["d", "e"]
arr_3 = [ *arr_1, "c", *arr_2 ]
p arr_3 # => ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

Using splat to decompose a hash

We can use a double splat (**) to perform a similar unpacking of a hash's key-value pairs. Double splat will only work with hashes where the keys are symbols:

old_hash = { a: 1, b: 2 }
new_hash = { **old_hash, c: 3 }
p new_hash # => {:a=>1, :b=>2, :c=>3}

Inject

Ruby's inject method is perhaps the most flexible when it comes to solving different problems. To master it's versatility, let's go through the mechanics of how inject works. To avoid confusion, we'll refer to this method as inject, but it is also known as reduce in other programming languages. Ruby has both an inject and a reduce method. Both are functionally identical.
Inject with only a block

The most straightforward way to use inject is to call it on an array and pass in a block. Like many enumerables, inject will iterate through the array, passing in the current element to the block. However, what makes inject very versatile is that the block should accept two params, the accumulator and the current element. inject will maintain an accumulator that will change over time, depending on our block. The block should return what the new accumulator should be after a single iteration. This is hard to visualize, so lets take a look at an example:

[11, 7, 2, 4].inject { |acc, el| acc + el }

Notice that the block params are always in the order of accumulator (acc) followed by element (el). Let's now explore inject in action. Because of how we are calling inject, the initial accumulator will be the first element of the array by default. So our first iteration has the acc set to 11 and el set to 7.

# FIRST ITERATION:
# acc = 11
# el = 7
# new_acc = 18
[11, 7, 2, 4].inject { |acc, el| acc + el }

Since the block results in 11 + 7, 18 will be assigned to acc in the next iteration. The el simply iterates to the next element of the array:

# SECOND ITERATION:
# acc = 18
# el = 2
# new_acc = 20
[11, 7, 2, 4].inject { |acc, el| acc + el }

Now the acc is 20 and we have to do one more iteration for the last el:

# acc = 20
# el = 4
# new_acc = 24
p [11, 7, 2, 4].inject { |acc, el| acc + el } # => 24

Since we are done iterating through all elements, inject will return the final accumulator. We were able to add up all elements of the array using inject! If you're not convinced of how useful inject is, you're probably thinking why don't we use a simpler loop or just use the Array#sum method. inject is an awesome method because of how versatile it is.

Applying our same steps as before, we'll leave it to you to ponder how inject can also find the total product of an array:

p [11, 7, 2, 4].inject { |acc, el| acc * el } # => 616

Or how about finding the minimum value in an array:

p [11, 7, 2, 4].inject do |acc, el|
    if el < acc
        el
    else
        acc
    end
end # => 2

Because the result of the block is always reassigned to be the new accumulator, we needed to return the current acc in the event that the el we are iterating through is not smaller than the acc. The else is necessary to avoid our block from resulting in nil.

The key to understanding inject is to remember that the accumulator will be reassigned to the result of the block on every iteration. Because inject performs a simple reassignment to the accumulator, we can design any block to control how the accumulator should change.
Inject with a default accumulator

In the last examples we described how the first element of the array will become the initial accumulator and the first iteration technically grabs the second element. We can also use inject by passing in our own initial accumulator. In this scenario, the acc will be our own value and the first el will be the first element of the array. Let's make 100 our initial accumulator:

# FIRST ITERATION:
# acc = 100
# el = 11
# new_acc = 111
[11, 7, 2, 4].inject(100) { |acc, el| acc + el }

# SECOND ITERATION
# acc = 111
# el = 7
# new_acc = 118
[11, 7, 2, 4].inject(100) { |acc, el| acc + el }

# THIRD ITERATION
# acc = 118
# el = 2
# new_acc = 120
[11, 7, 2, 4].inject(100) { |acc, el| acc + el }

# FOURTH ITERATION
# acc = 120
# el = 4
# new_acc = 124
p [11, 7, 2, 4].inject(100) { |acc, el| acc + el } # => 124

Nice! Being able to set our own initial accumulator can really open up our possibilities. Here's an inject that sums up all even numbers of an array:

[11, 7, 2, 4].inject(0) do |acc, el|
    if el.even?
        acc + el
    else
        acc
    end
end # => 6
