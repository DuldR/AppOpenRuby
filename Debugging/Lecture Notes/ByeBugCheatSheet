Using Byebug

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible,
you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it."

- Brian W. Kernighan

In Ruby versions 2.0 and greater, we can use Byebug as a debugging tool. Byebug lets us do many cool things. We can pause execution, step through our code one line at a time, take a look inside key variables and methods. To install it you can run the following command in your terminal:

gem install byebug
Byebug Cheatsheet

    before running your file
        require "byebug" - add to the top of your file to gain access to the gem
        debugger - place this line at a point in your file where you want to begin debugger mode
    while in debugger mode
        l <start line>-<end line> - list the line numbers in the specified range
            example: l 3-20
        step or s - step into the method call on the current line, if possible
        next or n - move to the next line of executed code
        break <line num> or b <line num> - place a breakpoint at the specified line number, this will pause execution again
        continue or c - resume normal execution of the code until a breakpoint
        display <variable> - automatically show the current value of a variable
